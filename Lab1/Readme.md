# First homework
## This homework was just about to get familiar to R syntax

### Let the vector x = (1, 8, 2, 6, 3, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5). Use R to calculate the following functions:

1. (x1 + x2 + ··· + x10) / 10
2. Find log2 (xi) for each i = 1, · · ·, 10
3. Find the difference between the largest and the highest, and its lowest value
4. Finds = (xi - 5.1) /2.514403 for each i = 1, · · ·, 10
5. Calculated, and media, I deviated, the standard vector of y = (y1, y2, y1, y10)


### The bill of your mobile varies monthly. Suppose that last year we paid the following values monthly 46 33 39 37 46 30 48 32 49 35 30 48. Enter these values ​​into a variable called invoice. Use a small amount to find the amount annual mobile phone bill last year. What is the lowest value paid in a month? Which is the largest? How many months does the invoice exceed 40? What was the percentage of the bill? What about the total bills?
