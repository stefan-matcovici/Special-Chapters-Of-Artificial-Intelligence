## Let the vector x = (1, 8, 2, 6, 3, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5). Use R to calculate the following functions:
1. (x1 + x2 + ··· + x10) / 10
2. Find log2 (xi) for each i = 1, · · ·, 10
3. Find the difference between the largest and the highest, and its lowest value
4. Finds = (xi - 5.1) /2.514403 for each i = 1, · · ·, 10
5. Calculated, and media, I deviated, the standard vector of y = (y1, y2, y1, y10)

## The bill of your mobile varies monthly. Suppose that last year we paid the following values monthly:
<center>46 33 39 37 46 30 48 32 49 35 30 48</center>

How many months does the invoice exceed 40? What was the percentage of the bill? What about the total bills?
